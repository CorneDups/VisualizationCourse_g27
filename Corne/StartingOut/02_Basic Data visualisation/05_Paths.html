<!--So M moves the pen across the paper without touching the paper; L does so with touching the paper. We can illustrate this by replacing one of the L s above into an M.-->

<!--Relative positions
The coordinates given for M and L are the absolute coordinates within the SVG element. We can also give positions that are relative to the current position. We do this using the lowercase m and l. This means that M 50,50 L 50,100 L 100,50 is the same as M 50,50 l 0,50 l 50,-50.-->
