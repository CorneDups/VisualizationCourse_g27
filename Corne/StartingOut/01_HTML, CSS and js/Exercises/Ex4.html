<p style="color: teal; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">
	This is a paragraph with style!
</p>

<!--
To apply an inline style to the paragraph to make the text appear in teal, you'll use the style attribute directly within the <p> tag. Additionally, for the bonus, you can change the font and the font size within the same style attribute.

Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

html
Copy code
<p style="color: teal; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">
	This is a paragraph with style!
</p>
Explanation:

color: teal; sets the text color to teal.
font-family: Arial, sans-serif; changes the font to Arial. If Arial is not available, it falls back to any available sans-serif font.
font-size: 16px; sets the size of the font to 16 pixels.
This code snippet will render the paragraph in the specified font, size, and color directly in the browser without needing an external CSS file. Adjust the font-size value and font-family according to your specific design needs.
